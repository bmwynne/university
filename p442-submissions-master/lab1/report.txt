Results:
	In this lab my partner and I were able to create an egg timer on the discovery board. This processes was complicated at first because we had both forgotten -
	- useful skills developed in C335. Once we were up to speed on old habits, we started to make headway upon reading the documentation and checking source code.
	First we printed a hello to the screen  through, the old faithful, serialT. This was reassuring. Then we read, stored, and manipulated data from serialT -
	- this was even more reassuring. Finally, through a couple hours of researching documentation and source code, we felt comfortable enough with threads in ChibiOS -
	- and we were able to complete the lab.

Difficulties:

	The initial learning curve lost since Spring 2014 was our biggest difficulty initially. We had to familiarize ourselves with the ChibiOS documentation.
	Once we were able to write data to the screen we encountered our first problem -- converting a character from user input into an integer. This was fixed through -
	- our our own implementation of C's atoi() function.

	Our most rough time with the assignment was learning how ChibiOS handles threads. We spent quite a while trying to "kill" a thread completely. However, after -
	- some research we learned that threads cannot be "destroyed" in ChibiOS for safety of memory management. The chThreadExit() function sufficed. Once we learned -
	- more concepts of threads (i.e. how the schedular handles them and implements them in memory) from the documentation we easily completed the assignment.
