Title: Oh the Places He'll Jog
App: App that tracks steps and location and logs steps and locations.
Date: 8/3/2016
Tasks: Set all the view controllers necessary to the project and went ahead and included some functionality on the home/map page. Runs google maps and asks for location data privlidges.  

Problems: Started to use UIView controller and custom objective C wrapper for a swiping hamburger style menu on the left side. Got the menu
to swipe and open up, however we could not get the controller to populate and point to the next controllers. Switched to UITabViewController
and just going the easy route now
