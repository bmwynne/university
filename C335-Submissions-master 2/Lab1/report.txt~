I went through the tutorials for unix and found that I knew all of them from
taking a C in Unix course and having programming courses with Professor German.

I then went to the C program and had only one small error, I forgot to add a ;.
I was able to create the infinite using a While (1) true loop. I implimented the sleep function from the imported library to space out the print statements.
I did not have any difficulties with this lab.
