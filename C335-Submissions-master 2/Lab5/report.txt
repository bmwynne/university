Results:

In this lab my lab partner and I were able to accomplish everything 
sucessfully, with problems only occuring in the beginning. Following
the c335 lab manual was pretty straight forward also, although 
there were some parts that were out of date and were hard to follow.
We were able to sucesfully run the Salae analyzer with the UART
and connect to it via the tty-USB0. The analyzer was interesting to use 
because it tracked input sent from the computer, and checked if the 
hardware recieved the output. This was visualized with graph like lines.
I was semi familliar with this program because I have used something like 
it called GTK Wave. The Putchar and Getchar functions worked as well,
with a small error coming from Putchar. Adding the WC program from Lab 2 was
also easy with no problems. 

Difficulties:
There were difficulties following the lab manual and inputting
the baud rate for the UART. The baud rate was much higher and 
we had to adjust it. Unfortunately this was not in the lab manual
and we had to figure it out the hard way.

Another difficulty was when we copy and pasted the putchar from the
lab git hub, the " ' ' " were interpretted as invalid characters,
and the function did not work. When we typed them in manually it worked.




What did you learn:
I learned how to use a Saelae logic analyzer and to hook up wires to
different pins to get the UART to work. I also continued to learn that
it is hard to program on hardware without debugging. We also learned 
how to print to the computer from the hardware.
