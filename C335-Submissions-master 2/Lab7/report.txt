Lab 7

Results:

Currently we have several small thngs going for us. The code compiles and downloads. Also,
we were able to have values reported to the screen, although all of the values
are the same at x, y ,and z printing 288.174. 

Difficulties:

We had difficulties with the driver for the gyro. First we did not initialize 
both RawData and tmpBuffer as arrays. Also we did not initialize some of the variables
as type unsigned int. Once That was solved all the printable errors were resolved.
Now things are currently tricky. There is some small bug that we are trying to find 
within the code. Nobody at the moment can find it.

What did I learn:

So far I have learned how a spi interface works and how it communicates with
slave peripherals. I also have learned how to send and get data from the spi to the 
console. Although at the moment not the correct data is being received. 
This will be updated once the lab is solved.
