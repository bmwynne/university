Lab 11

Difficulties:
-----------------------------------------------------------
In this lab my lab partner and I had difficulties with putchar() and getchar(). Our enqueue and dequeue worked properly.
The problem was that our  putchar() function was not working, and therefore serialT was not working. Init functions that were
inside of our systick were causing our putchar() to not work. Once we removed the init functions putchar() worked and we were able to print
characters to serialT. We knew our queue was working because characters were printing and our flag, which let us know
when array values were being hit, was printed. 

We also had errors recieving data. SerialT recieved four characters (4bytes) because the queue was of size int (4bytes). Example: a -> aaaa




What we learned:
------------------------------------------------------------

In this lab we learned how to use interrupts and handlers to have the hardware execute code via a periodic interrupt based on a 
programmed frequency. An example of this is our LED cycle function. The programmed "normal" refresh rate is 100Hz.
When the user input button is pressed the handler is executed, interrupting the normal process, and slows the rate to
10Hz. 

We also learned how to impliment a circular queue system to store int(characters) in an array. Putchar() enqueues data to the TX queue
while dequeue removes data from the getchar() RX queue. 

We also learned how to use github to branch projects. At first we did not mess with this function of Git.
After learning how to use it we found it to be very beneficial in fixing errors and testing new things.
