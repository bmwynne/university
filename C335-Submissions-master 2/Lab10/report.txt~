Questions:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Real-time clocks (RTC) are integrated circuits that keep track of current
time. RTCs are different from ordinary hardware clocks because ordinary 
hardware clocks instead count time in non human units. There are several
benefits to using RTCs:
- Low power consumption
- Frees the main system for time-critical tasks
- Sometimes more accurate than other methods

2. Using the f3d_delay_uS() function is more accurate than the delay loop. The
delay has an advantage of being more accurate because it frees the system from
calculations and uses an integrated circuit rather than signals between
registers.

3.
