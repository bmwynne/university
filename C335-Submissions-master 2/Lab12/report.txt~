Lab 12


Difficulties: 
--------------------------------------------------------
During this lab one of our biggiest difficulties was getting our Makefile to be accurate, containing all the files
and objects that we need. In the Makefile we included "<diskio.o>", which caused problems. Once this was removed things
were compiling correctly. Also, certin .WAV files were not working in our code. It was important that the sameple rate 
was 11,025 and the bit rate 8.  At the end of the lab we thought we had a bug, altough our nunchuk was not plugged in
all the way. 


What we learned:
