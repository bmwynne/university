C335 Computer Structures
Final Project: Quick Draw

Tasks I was responsible for:


I helped with development of the game by working with Paul for the games logic and coding some portions of the game.
I directly coded some audio and was in charge of converting and implementing the custom audio, before we knew how to do it. 
I also was in charge of creating and coding the second player portion of the game. I had to take the code from the 
single player game and instantiated two of everything as well as get the second nunchuk to work and read data. This proved
to be more difficult than I thought because I had to seperate calculations and create different boundaries for the matrices.
