C335 Lab 4


Results:

We were able to complete all of the tasks within laboratory 4. We were able to turn on a light, turn on
multiple lights, and sequencially light all of the leds. We were also able to seperate the code from 
the main.c file into the corresponding led driver.

Difficulties:

There were some difficulties within this lab. At first getting to understand the board and documentation was
a little daunting. Although through studying the schematics and lab details we were able to overcome this. 
The second difficulty was producing the sequencial order of leds. The problem was not the logic, but rather
the order of pins within the on and off section of the driver. For some reason if the on and off section of
pins were not coded correspondingly, the leds would light up sequencially in pairs. This was fixed when
both on and off were coded from 9-15 and 8, correpsondingly. 

What did you learn:

I felt like I personally learned a lot in this lab and it has been my favorite lab as a undergrad
in CS. I have always wanted to work with hardware and this was my first chance. It seemed very
daunting at first but once I learned how the pins worked with the source code, it was much easier.
I felt like I learned a lot about coding on hardware while not being able to use a debugger, and the
challenges that follow. I also learned how to overcome through tedious watch of code.
