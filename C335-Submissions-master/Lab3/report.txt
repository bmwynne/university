Results:

I was able to accomplish creating the Makefile poly, containing poly.c and
dump.c. The Makefile compiled sucessfully and the binary poly was created. 
The binary ran sucessfully. I then continued to work on the lab by extending 
dump.c. I was able to prent all of the data types according and in alignment, 
kind of.I am still trying to continue working on it and will do my best to get
help and finish it during lab.

Difficulties:

I was unable to figure out how to sort the unassigned characters and shorten
some of the data so it overflows to the next line which makes the formatting
look off.

Learned:
I learned how to show different types of types from the same data in C. I was 
briefly introduced to this in Whitmers C291 class, but this lab further
elaborated on the topic.
