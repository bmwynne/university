My computer comes equipped with an upgraded processor: the 2.9 GHz Core i7 under the moniker “Ivy Bridge”. This particular processor has 1.2 billion transistors (Shimpi and Smith). With Moore’s Law predicting that a transistor’s count should double approximately every two years, it will be interesting to see if this case holds up. 	According to the Wikipedia article on Moore’s Law: the transistor count and rate of acceleration on processor development has slowed down since the development of the 2012 “Ivy Bridge”. The consecutive releases of Intel processors have not doubled. Intel’s “Haswell” release has seen a transistor increase to 1.4 billion transistors, while the upcoming “Skylake” is rumored to include 1.9 billion transistors (Shimpi). 	While these processors’ transistor counts are not doubling, their sizes are definitely shrinking. In 1971 the Intel 4004 had a processor size of 10 micrometers (Wikipedia). In 2011 Intels “Sandy Bridge” processor had a size of 32nm, and in 2012 “Ivy Bridge” shrank to 22nm. The upcoming “Skylake” is rumored to shrink to 14nm (Shimpi). 	If current trends extrapolate to the next 10 years, I would guess that processors’ transistor counts would not double ever 18 months – 2 years. However, I believe that processors will continue to shrink until the advancement of transistors on silicon or no longer possible. 	Power Dissipation:		I found that my processor has a power consumption of 55W at 1.5V, which translates to 36.7 Amps. This is a lot closer to my oven, which operates at 50 watts. At 20 Amps my house’s circuit should break. The excessive current in the oven would break the fuse, if it did not have a special electrical outlet for appliances. The same principle applies to the processor in my computer. The power supply for the computer takes the alternating current and converts it to direct current. It also lowers the voltage delivered to the computer and filters the signal and normalizes it.  	According to Best Buy, the average American household’s oven utilizes 2.0kWh. The power dissipation of a microprocessor is how much energy is lost to both power it and through heat lost. We have to cool a microprocessor because we want to utilize it. If we continued to let the microprocessor heat up it would essentially act like a stove—it would burn up. We do not have to heat up stoves because we need the heat to cook our foods. Voltage:	Power supply voltages have decreased over the last 30 years. According to Wikipedia, the first IBM power supply support +12 V and – 12V, then moving to +5 V and – 5V. Currently power supplies have shrank to 3.3V and some are less than 1.5V. I think that power supplies have shrank because it not only saves money but also reduces the amount of energy lost as heat. Power supplies that are smaller as also more efficient and waste less energy and require less cooling. This is also beneficial to personal computing and large scale computing—such as in servers. Works Cited:"ARK | Intel® CoreâÑ¢ I5-4460 Processor (6M Cache, up to 3.40 GHz)." ARK Product Launch.
