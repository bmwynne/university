1.) What is the number of combinations of the input signals for 4-bit parallel adder?
     There are 256 combinations.
2. )What is the number of test vectors for the 16-bit parallel adder?

   I will create parallel for loops that go through the inputs and assign values to the combinations.

3. ) I was not able to find the test vector that produced a faulty response.
4. ) ERROR:
The value of A is: 0100, B is: 1111, and S is 1011.
5. )ERROR:
The value of A is: 0100, B is: 1111, and S is 1011.
the correct output of S is : 0011
