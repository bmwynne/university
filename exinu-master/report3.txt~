How is synchronization achieved?

Synchronization is achieved by setting a count of 1 with producer and a count of 0 with consumer. 
By allowing producer to begin with a count of 1, the function wait will not be blocked the first time it is called. 
This allows consumer to print initial n because the first call from consumed is blocked. The producerwaits for consumption before incrementing n.
